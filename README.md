Index.html is a simple login for employees 

I made Booksearch a homepage for searching convience. From here user employees can go to add-delete page, search, or logout.

Add-delete page has clear "Two way street" to show where user is headed at all times so no confusion.

Add page allows employee's to put in new materials for sale.

Delete page allows employee's to delete from inventory. There is a problem with not knowing who is removing inventory. There is a manager page for info on who deletes page and maybe add restrictions.
